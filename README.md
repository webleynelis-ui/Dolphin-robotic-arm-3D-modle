# Robotic Arm CAD Model (Reconstructed from Open-Source STL)

This repository contains the **reconstructed CAD source files** of a low-cost robotic arm developed as part of an academic project.

## Overview

The CAD models provided in this repository were **not directly converted** from existing STL files. Instead, they were **recreated from scratch** based on careful **measurement and analysis of an open-source robotic arm design**. The objective of this work is to provide **editable, parametric CAD source files** that are suitable for further modification, analysis, and academic use.

## Reference Design

The original mechanical concept and STL files that inspired this work were published by **markdang** on MakerWorld:

- Reference model: *Dolphin Arm Robotic Arm*  
- Source: https://makerworld.com/en/models/91498-dolphin-arm-robotic-arm#profileId-97881

The referenced STL files were used **only as a geometric and structural reference**. All CAD models in this repository were **independently recreated** by measuring the physical dimensions and reconstructing the geometry in CAD software.

## What This Repository Provides

- Fully editable CAD source files (SolidWorks format)
- Parametric part and assembly structure
- Clean feature history suitable for redesign and analysis
- A reproducible mechanical model for education and research

## Motivation

STL files are difficult to modify and unsuitable for design iteration or kinematic analysis.  
This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing **source-level CAD models**, enabling:

- Mechanical redesign and optimization  
- Integration with simulation and digital twin workflows  
- Educational use in robotics and mechanical engineering courses  

## License and Attribution

This work is provided for **educational and research purposes**.  
If you use this repository, please acknowledge both:
- The original concept by **markdang** (MakerWorld link above)
- This reconstructed CAD source repository

## Disclaimer

This repository is **not an official release** of the original designer and is **not affiliated** with MakerWorld or the original author. The reconstructed models may differ from the original STL design due to measurement tolerances and modeling assumptions.
